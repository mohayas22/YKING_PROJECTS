# MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM.
Introduction:
The Movie Recommendation System using Content Filtering is a web application that aims to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences and previous movie ratings. The system utilizes the concepts of content filtering and cosine similarity to identify similarities between movies and generate accurate recommendations. The application is developed using Streamlit, a popular Python library for creating interactive web applications.

Key Features:
User Registration and Login: The web app allows users to create an account, log in, and maintain their profiles. Each user can have a unique set of preferences and ratings.
Movie Database: The system maintains a comprehensive database of movies, including information such as title, genre, release year, director, and cast. This database serves as the foundation for generating recommendations.
Content Filtering: The recommendation engine uses content filtering techniques to analyze the content features of movies, such as genre, actors, and directors. By comparing these features with user preferences, the system identifies movies that are similar to the ones the user has previously enjoyed.
Cosine Similarity: The system employs cosine similarity, a popular similarity metric, to measure the similarity between movies. By calculating the cosine similarity between the content features of movies, the system can recommend movies that have a high degree of similarity to the user's preferred movies.
Personalizd Recommendations: Based on the user's preferences and ratings, the system generates personalized movie recommendations. Users can view these recommendations on their dashboard and explore additional details about each movie.
Rating and Feedback: Users can rate movies they have watched and provide feedback on the recommendations. This feedback helps to refine the recommendation algorithm and improve the accuracy of future recommendations.
Streamlit Web App: The entire recommendation system is built as a web application using Streamlit. Streamlit provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the system seamlessly.
Responsive Design: The web app is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal user experience across different devices and screen sizes.
Implementation Steps:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Collect a dataset of movies and their corresponding features such as genre, actors, directors, etc. Preprocess the dataset to ensure consistency and remove any irrelevant or duplicate information.
Cosine Similarity Calculation: Implement the cosine similarity algorithm to calculate the similarity scores between movies based on their content features.
User Registration and Login: Develop the user registration and login functionality using authentication mechanisms. Users should be able to create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles.
User Preferences and Ratings: Create a user interface where users can set their preferences, rate movies they have watched, and provide feedback on recommendations.
Recommendation Generation: Implement the recommendation engine using content filtering and cosine similarity. The system should analyze user preferences and generate a list of recommended movies based on similarity scores.
Streamlit Web App Development: Utilize Streamlit to build the web application interface. Design the user interface for user registration, login, movie recommendations, rating, and feedback.
Integration and Deployment: Integrate all the components of the system, test for functionality and accuracy, and deploy the web application to a suitable hosting platform.

Conclusion:
The Movie Recommendation System using Content Filtering with Cosine Similarity and Streamlit Python Web App offers an intuitive and personalized movie recommendation experience. By leveraging content filtering techniques and cosine similarity, the system generates accurate recommendations tailored to each user's preferences. The web app's user-friendly interface, built using Streamlit, ensures a seamless and enjoyable user experience.
